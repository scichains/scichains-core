In a case of folders, each folder is scanned recursively, and all multi-chain JSONs, found in the folder and its subfolders, become available to use.\nNote: every path is trimmed, i.e. leading/trailing space characters, including line feeds, are removed. Thus, if you need several paths, separated by \";\", you can place each path in a separate line.\nYou can use here relative paths (without starting \"/\" or \"c:\\\"), for example, \"test.dat\" or \"samples/test.dat\". They will be resolved relative the current folder, containing the executed chain.\nIf this path starts with substring %TEMP%, %TEMP%/ or %TEMP%x. where x is OS-depended file separator character, this substring is replaced with the full path to the system temp directory (System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\")) with ending file separator. For example, it is correct to write here %TEMP%my_file.dat, %TEMP%/my_file.dat or (in Windows) %TEMP%\\my_file.dat.\nAlso you can use in this string Java system properties: \"${name}\", for example: \"${java.io.tmpdir}\", and executor system properties \"${path.name.ext}\", \"${path.name}\", \"${file.name.ext}\", \"${file.name}\", \"${resources}\" (chain path/file name with/without extension, resource folder of the platform, containing this function).",
